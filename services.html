  <div id="space-planning" class="dropdown-content">
    <p  style="color:rgb(11, 1, 20);font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large">
      Space planning is a crucial aspect of interior designing that involves analyzing and organizing the available
       space to optimize its functionality, efficiency, and aesthetic appeal. It involves determining the placement of furniture,
        fixtures, and other elements within a room or an entire building to create a well-designed and harmonious environment. Here are 
        some key steps and considerations for effective space planning in interior design:
         <br><br>
    <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b> 1. Understand the Purpose and Requirements:</b></p><br> </u><i>Begin by understanding the purpose of the space and the specific
       requirements of the client or occupants. Consider factors such as the intended use of the space, the number of 
       people who will use it, and any specific needs or preferences they may have.
      </i><br><br><center><img src="planning2.jpg" height="300" width="300" /></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b> 2. Gather Information and Measure:</b></p><br> </u><i> Take accurate measurements of the space, including its dimensions, 
      doors, windows, and other architectural elements. Note any obstructions, such as pillars or structural
       limitations that may affect the layout.</i>
      <br><br><center><img src="measure.jpg " height="300" width="300" alt="Interview" /></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b> 3. Establish Zones and Circulation: </b></p><br> </u><i></i>Identify different functional zones within the space, 
      such as seating areas, workstations, storage, and circulation paths. Determine how people will
       move through the space and ensure clear and efficient pathways between different areas.</i>
      <br><br><center><img src="kitchenimage.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="Interview" /></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b></b>4. Furniture Placement:</b></p><br> </u><i> Decide on the arrangement of furniture and other elements based on the 
      space's purpose and the activities that will take place within it. Consider the size, scale, and proportions
       of the furniture pieces, as well as the relationship between them and the overall space.</i>
      <br><br><br><br> <center><img src="furniture.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b>5. Consider Ergonomics: </b></p><br> </u><i>Pay attention to ergonomics, ensuring that furniture and equipment are arranged
       in a way that promotes comfort, ease of use, and safety. Consider factors such as proper seating height,
        desk and counter heights, and adequate space for movement.</i>
      <br><br><br><br> <center><img src="Ergonomics.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b>6. Utilize Vertical Space:</b></p><br> </u><i> Maximize the use of vertical space by incorporating 
      storage solutions, shelves, cabinets, or wall-mounted elements. This helps free up floor space 
      and keeps the area organized and clutter-free.</i>
      <br><br><br><br> <center><img src="vertical.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b> 7. Lighting and Electrical Outlets:</b></p><br> </u><i> Plan for appropriate lighting, both natural
       and artificial, to create a well-lit and visually appealing space. Consider the placement
        of electrical outlets, switches, and fixtures to ensure convenient access and proper distribution of light.</i>
      <br><br><br><br> <center><img src="lighting.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b>8. Balance and Proportions:</b></p><br> </u><i> Maintain a sense of balance and proportion throughout the space. Consider the 
      relationship between different elements, such as furniture, wall art, and architectural features, to create a 
      visually pleasing and harmonious composition.</i>
      <br><br> <center><img src="proportions.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b> 9. Flexibility and Adaptability:</b></p><br> </u><i> Design spaces that are flexible and adaptable to accommodate future changes
       or different uses. Consider modular furniture, movable partitions, and flexible layouts that can easily be modified
        to meet evolving needs.</i>
      <br><br> <center><img src="interview.jpg" height="300" width="300"/></center>
      <p style="color:rgb(123, 4, 54)"> <u><b>10. Accessibility and Safety:</b></p><br> </u><i> Ensure that the space is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.
       Incorporate features such as ramps, handrails, and wide doorways where necessary. Also, consider safety regulations and
        guidelines when planning the space.</i>
      <br><br> <center><img src="safety.jpg" height="300" width="300" /></center>
      Remember that effective space planning requires a balance between functionality, aesthetics, and the specific needs
       of the occupants. It's essential to collaborate with clients, architects, and other professionals to ensure the final design
        meets all requirements and creates a cohesive and inviting environment.</p>

  <a class="button-link" href="#color-palette">Color Palette Selection</a><br>
  <div id="color-palette" class="dropdown-content">
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMany Interior Designers and Decorators ask themselves continuously how to choose the right colors
       for a client’s project. A lot of variables take place when we design interior spaces and decorate them, 
       as the main goal is to build an atmosphere that surprises your client.
  <br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA color palette or a color scheme is a selection of colors that combine perfectly together.
       This mix can be constructed by color similarity or by the opposition between the colors to create an emotional 
       expression, a dynamic frame, and a visually harmonic design structure.
      <br><br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnderstanding the color wheel and its twelve colors is the first step for pairing your infinite
       color options to decorate. Whether it is the walls of a home, the combination of colors of furniture 
       and textiles, the goal is to find a balance between sophistication and functionality.<br>
      <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
      Color is a fundamental element for human beings. We observe the world through tones and sensations, 
      as colors possess a range of symbolism in our culture.<br>
      <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
      One of the first studies dedicated to the subject was written by the German poet, artist and politician, 
      Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1810 entitled Theory of Colors. In his work, Goethe argued that color can be 
      studied from different perspectives, such as physical and functional. His most important contribution is a theory 
      about the emotional qualities and attributes of colors and how each color can affect people’s moods.<br>
      <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
      For this reason, Goethe’s thoughts had become a primary reference in many professional fields such as art, decoration,
       and graphic design. Goethe said “light and darkness, brightness and obscurity, or if a more general expression is preferred,
        light and its absence, one necessary to the production of color . . . color itself is a degree of darkness“.<br>
